<p>From the key features above, I will tell you about FAMILY.  A family is one of the greatest gift god has given to all living creatures on the earth including humans. It is a privilege to have a happy family as not everyone in the world has it.  The joy of living with our parents, fighting with your siblings over petty can just make you smile the moment you think of it.  
<p>Family is important to every one of us and we all love our family. Wherever we go in this world and whatever we may achieve, our heart and soul will always be in our home because it is where our beautiful family is. Nothing in this world can be stronger than the bonding of the blood. 
<p>The members of the same family may have differences of opinions, may quarrel often for silly things but in spite of all these it is our family that supports us during our ups and downs.  As the saying goes, “Family is the best thing you could ever wish for. They are there for you during the ups and downs and love you no matter what”.  Contrary to this saying, we cannot choose our family as we choose our friends. But I can say that I’m blessed with a wonderful family. My family is very merrier year by year with 6 members excluding my brother in law, sister in law, my niece, and nephew   .</p>

<p> Last but not least, Immediately after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was announced, many lost their main source of income, especially those doing their own business. Despite the challenges, some strive to persevere. I’m ain as a fresh graduate couldn’t agree more that our economy badly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Day by day the number of unemployment in our country increased because of our economy.  On this pandemic covid-19 our country faces difficult days ahead and I decide to do some small business " brownies cookie " to make extra money.  Alhamdulillah I received so many order and its beyond my expectation.
